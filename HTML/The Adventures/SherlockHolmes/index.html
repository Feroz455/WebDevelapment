  <h1>A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA</h1>
  <div class="">


    <pre>
            To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him
            mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and
            predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion
             akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly
             , were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind.
             He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine
            that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself
            in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save
            with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observe
            r—excellent for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions.
            But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his
            own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a
            distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental
            results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of
            his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a
            strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but
            one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler,
            of dubious and questionable memory.

            I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away
            from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred int
            erests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master o
            f his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,
            while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemi
            an soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his o
            ld books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambit
            ion, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own ke
            en nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of cr
            ime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of
            observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those myste
            ries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. Fro
            m time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summ
            ons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up
            of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and
           finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and su
           ccessfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of
           his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of
           the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.

            One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning fro
            m a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice),
             when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remem
             bered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooi
             ng, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seiz
             ed with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was e
             mploying his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit,
             and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice i
             n a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swift
             ly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands claspe
             d behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitud
             e and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had ris
             en out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of som
             e new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber whic
             h had formerly been in part my own.

            His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think
            , to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he wa
            ved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicate
            d a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before t
            he fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.

            “Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have pu
            t on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”

            “Seven!” I answered.

            “Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I
            fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me
             that you intended to go into harness.”

            “Then, how do you know?”

            “I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting you
            rself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless
            servant girl?”

            “My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly hav
            e been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I
            had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but
            as I have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As t
            o Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice,
            but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.”

            He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.

            “It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the ins
            ide of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leat
            her is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been
            caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of
            the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my
            double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you
            had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London sl
            avey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelli
            ng of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his righ
            t forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show w
            here he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I d
            o not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”

            I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his pr
            ocess of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,
            “the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I
            could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your
            reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I bel
            ieve that my eyes are as good as yours.”

            “Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself
            down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The distinc
            tion is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which
            lead up from the hall to this room.”

            “Frequently.”

            “How often?”

            “Well, some hundreds of times.”

            “Then how many are there?”

            “How many? I don’t know.”

            “Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just
            my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have
            both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these
            little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or t
            wo of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He th
            rew over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lyin
            g open upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it
            aloud.”

            The note was undated, and without either signature or address.

            “There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,”
            it said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of th
            e very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal hous
            es of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted w
            ith matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerat
            ed. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in yo
            ur chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visit
            or wear a mask.”

            “This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it
            means?”

            “I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one
            has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, ins
            tead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you ded
            uce from it?”

            I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was wr
            itten.

            “The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked, endeav
            ouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not be
            bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.”

            “Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English
            paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”

            I did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “
            G” with a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper.

            “What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.

            “The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”

            “Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’ w
            hich is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like
             our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Le
             t us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy bro
             wn volume from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It
            is in a German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad
            . ‘Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and
            for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, w
            hat do you make of that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great
            blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.

            “The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.

            “Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note
            the peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we ha
            ve from all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not hav
            e written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs.
            It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German
           who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing
           his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our
           doubts.”

            As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating w
            heels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes
            whistled.

            “A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out o
            f the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hund
            red and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if
            there is nothing else.”

            “I think that I had better go, Holmes.”

            “Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.
            And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”

            “But your client—”

            “Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.
            Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.”

            A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in t
            he passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a lo
            ud and authoritative tap.

            “Come in!” said Holmes.

            A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inch
            es in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was
            rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin
            to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleev
            es and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak
            which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured si
            lk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single
            flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which
            were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impressi
            on of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance.
            He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the
            upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black
            vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for
            his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part o
            f the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick
            , hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pu
            shed to the length of obstinacy.

            “You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly m
            arked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from
            one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.

            “Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, D
            r. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. W
            hom have I the honour to address?”

            “You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I u
            nderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and d
            iscretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme import
            ance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.”

            I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back i
            nto my chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before th
            is gentleman anything which you may say to me.”

            The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he
            , “by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end
             of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is
             not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influe
             nce upon European history.”

            “I promise,” said Holmes.

            “And I.”

            “You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “The aug
            ust person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and
             I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called my
             self is not exactly my own.”

            “I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly.

            “The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has t
            o be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and se
            riously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak
            plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, heredita
            ry kings of Bohemia.”
