      <h3><i>Introduction to Algorithms</i></h3>
      <p>
        Yes, I am coauthor of <i>Introduction to Algorithm,</i> along with
        <a href="">Charles Leiserson</a>,<a href="">Ron Rivest</a>, and
        <a href="">Chiff Stein</a>. For MIT Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a
        post on their blog about
        <a href="">the secreat to writting a best-selling textbook</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are answer to a few frequently asked quesrtion about
        <i>Introduction to Algorithms:</i>
      </p>

      <dl>
        <i
          ><dt>
            Will there be a fourth edition? If so, where will it be available?
          </dt></i
        >

        <dd>
          The fourth editio was released on 5th April 2022. The
          <a href="">MIT press site for the book</a> has links to sites that
          sell it.
        </dd>
        <i> <dt>Where can I find a list of errata?</dt></i>

        <dd>
          For the fourth edition, we maintain an <a href="">errata</a> page that
          allows you to list errors by date, by page, or by severity.
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>
          For the second and third editions, we maintained an
          <a href="">errata page</a> that allows you to list errors by date, by
          page, by severity, or by discoverer. There is even an incremental
          update feature, allowing you to list only the errors posted since the
          last date that you asked about. We stopped logging errors for the
          third edition in January 2019 so that we could focus on preparing the
          fourth edition.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <i>How do I report errors?</i>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          First, please visit the <a href="">errata page</a> to verify that the
          error has not been reported already. Once you have determined that you
          have found an unreported error, send email to clrs-bugs@mit.edu. We
          will respond as quickly as possible, often within a day.
        </dd>
        <br />
        <dd>
          Please use the
          <a href="mailto:clrs-bugs@mit.edu">clrs-bugs@mit.edu</a> address only
          to report errors. If you have a suggestion or a question, please
          contact me directly at
          <a href="mailto:thc@cs.dartmouth.edu">thc@cs.dartmouth.edu</a>

      <dt>
        <i>Can I get solutions to exercises and problems?</i>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        As of the third edition, we are making available solutions for select
        set of exercises and problems. They are prosted at the MIT Press
        website.
      </dd>
      <br />
      <dd>
        We have also produced an Instructor's Manual, which is available only to
        instructors who have adopted the book for course use. The manual has
        lecture notes and solutions to additional exercises and problems, but by
        no means all of them. (I estimate that writing up solutions to all
        exercises and problems would take somewhere between 2000 and 3000
        pages.) You'll need to contact the MIT Press for passwords to access the
        manual site and the files. (Contact information is at the MIT Press
        website.) You cannot get the passwords from me or from any of my
        coauthors.

        "Noted residents, past and present" in the
        <a href="">Wikipedia page on Oceanside, NY</a> , but someone removed me
        from the Oceanside page with the notation "Removed notable people who
        barely lived there or people who are not notable." Since I lived in
        Oceanside for the first 18 years of my life, I can only conclude that I
        am not notable.
